CAPTAIN
tooltip doesn't work
pool status and lock pool should be in the top right corner don't duplciate without intention (add that to rules)
we need 'copy my link' and 'share invite link [copy]' in that same box
Leaderboard should be the main call to action, i liked the arrow
get rid of warning on the bottom

Add prop has two +s
Add prop isn't working, but should continue to show, you still save each one individually

PLAYER
Should match the info on the captains page but this size
"Copy my link"
"Share my link"
Should also have a tooltip
Pick saved toaster is still showing up (for both?)

Based on what I'm seeing there's plenty of room to merge the headers UI too, there are only small differences, they don't need to drift apart

LEADERBOARD
no captain badge
view other's picks doesn't seem to be implemented
